# Face-Recognition-Attendence
A real-time attendance system using face recognition built with Python. The project detects faces from live video feeds, recognizes them by comparing with pre-encoded images, and logs attendance based on successful matches. It uses OpenCV for video capture and image processing, and the face_recognition library for face detection and encoding.
